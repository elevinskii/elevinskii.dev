## Hey there!

It's always been hard to find right words to introduce myself, but I will try.

Sr. PHP Developer, Full Stack Magento2 Developer (4x Certified), Team Lead - it is already 10 years I've been
fascinated by ecommerce cutting-edge technologies and web programming at all. It's been a fairy journey where
the things are changing so fast, and learning process will never end.

Always trying to retrieve the most incredible experience, I would like to have some homelike place for sharing
my technical views and thoughts with anyone, who would consider them useful at least.

**Enjoy and happy coding!**
