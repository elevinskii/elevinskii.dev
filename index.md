## Hey there!

It's always been hard to find right words to introduce myself, but I will try.

[Full Stack Magento2 Developer](https://u.magento.com/certification/directory/dev/id/2590859){:target="_blank"}
(proud owner of 4 certificates), Sr. PHP Developer, Ecommerce Enthusiast - it is already 10 years I've been
fascinated by ecommerce cutting-edge technologies and web programming at all. It's been an awesome journey
where the things are changing so fast, and learning process will never end.

Always trying to retrieve the most incredible experience, I would like to have some homelike place for sharing
my technical views and thoughts with anyone, who would consider them useful at least.
